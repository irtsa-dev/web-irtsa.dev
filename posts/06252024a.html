Cool, a first post! Am I experienced in creating blogs? No, if you could collect all the "nopes" said around the world,  I bet it 
wouldn't come close to the amount of them I could give here. Nevertheless, I will give it a shot here. 
As the title of this post states, I will be talking about my little process in making this site (as bare bones as it is).



Did I want to make a crazy site? No, and neither did any of the "options" out there for blog sites such as templates or 
suggestions seem to fit how I imagined this to look. That is why I decided to go out of my way to make this despite my
inexperience with html and minor experience with css, the two "languages" I used (a debate can be had here, so I recognize that
these are not seen as programming languages. I will be referring to them as just languages because css is markup/stylesheet
language and html is also mostly stated to be a markup language. So, know when I say language, I am not meaning programming
language but using it as general term). It wasn't really difficult as I had many sources to help with making this and I am
happy with how it turned out.

I did not want much, just a little home page to explain myself a little bit, a blog to post updates on what I am doing that
is related to programming, and a contact page so people know where they can get into contact with me if they so choose to.
I would like to thank <a href="https://codepen.io/WhisnuYs/collections/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WhisnuYs</a> for the navigation menu that my site
uses at the top! I modified the css to fit my theme, but the main bulk of the css for it comes from them.

I know I stated that I had inexperience with html, but that isn't 100% true. I am not an insane know it all when it comes to
html, so I do not know every trick there is with it, nor am I confident in using it like how I am with other languages I use
more regularly. However, because a lot of places utilize html like markup to modify how a bio will look like (like github),
I got some experience from that as well as other instances where I did used html in a more professional setting in developing
parts of a website for a place (I will not list for personal reasons).

That minor experience along with a slight want to have my own "site" to put what I want out is what spawned this. As a little
note for other people out there starting out in this field, do not be afraid to experiment. I learned a lot of what I know on
my own time just by experimenting and seeing what things do as well as seeing what others had done. It can be fun to just mess
around a bit, give it a try!
