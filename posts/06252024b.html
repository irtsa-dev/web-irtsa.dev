I guess I should make a quick post as well on the latest project I put out: Conarn. So here is a quick post here about that.



Conarn is a small project that I am working on that allows users to edit the save files of the game <b>Content warning</b> by
<b>Landfall</b>. You can find a link to it <a href="https://github.com/irtsa-dev/conarn" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>. if you are interested in it!
Funny enough, it actually did not start out as a GUI, rather a CLI, photos of it are shown below.

Yeah, cool times they were. It actually stayed that way for about a month before I started to develop the GUI version. I was the only one using it so I 
figured there would be no point in making it look "fancy" (I am not an artist or designer, so to me it is fancy). The process of making it a GUI was not
too difficult for the most part. I say for the most part because once I wanted to have a loading animation to make sure the program had time to make
changes I wanted it to be making, it was a headache. A 3 hour long headache. This is because I wanted to utilize a gif version which I thought would be
easier, turns out nope. In fact every method I tried such as loading each frame as an image, storing that in a list using Tkinter's photo image and later
referencing them. I tried to load just the gif and playing it hope it would be okay with that. On and on and got nothing. Eventually I settled on just
making each frame of the gif an image, putting that into a folder, and creating a customtkinter label to handle update the image every couple milliseconds
ended up being the way to go.

Glossing over a few extra details, I figured out how to get the Tkinter's notebook to work with the tabs for each kind of information I wanted to be able
to edit. On the first tab would be simple information such as the file's index, the amount of money, views, and more. The other two tabs for inside and
outside items respectively were made. When testing certain values, I did find out certain extreme values for money, views, and seeds tended to make the
save file unplayable, as such I limited the values for them to prevent that issue. Soon, I had a working GUI for it but had no idea what to call it.

I wanted to just use "Content Warning Save File Editor" but an obvious issue came with that: way too long. Obviously, so I sat there for a good bit before
Conarn was decided. How did I decide on Conarn? Funny, if you take content warning, chop a good bit off the end of content to get "con" and the same for
warning to get "warn" I had "conwarn." Once you removed the "w" in "conwarn" we are now left with what I would call the program: Conarn.

After this, I made it public on github. I left out the ability to edit network deals because that would be a bit more complicated than what I wanted for
the time being, but I do plan to add that in and left in bits of code (as well as now adding in some more) to allow for this functionality. I also
eventually updated Conarn to have a nice "logo" that was similar to Content Warning which is seen below.

Eventually I added this to the gui to get the current look as it can now be seen today.

Overall I did enjoy trying to make this GUI. Is it the first time I made a GUI? Technically no, I have another project that I made a long time ago and
still sometimes use for just myself. I do not plan to make it public as that would defeat the purpose of it. For now, this was the first time I made
something like this public and available for everyone. I hope everyone will find it easy enough to use and find some more fun in their sessions.
