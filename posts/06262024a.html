            VRChat Avatar Downloading
        </h1>
        
        <pre>
Weird topic I know, VRChat? Yeah I know, but I would like to put this somewhere at least because it is still a thing that can be done.


          
For those unaware, VRChat is a virtual reality / also desktop chatting / social interaction game where users can create their own avatars and worlds
utilizing unity and VRChat's custom SDK (and now new tools for easier package management). It has moments of genuine fun with friends and it also has
a good share of toxic individuals and groups within the game. I am not going to go too indepth about every aspect of this game, I only want to touch
base on one: avatar downloading.

This practice can also be called "ripping" as you are essentially downloading, extracting, and piecing back together avatars made by other people which may
or may not have been intended to be readily distributed in this manner. Now, one way is by injected code (in other words, utilizing a client and/or loader
for said modification) into the game to allow users to do things the developers did not intend. One such functionality is the ability to download the avatars
of other people (i.e. "ripping").

Majority of people believe you need a client / mod in order to achieve this, however, I am here to say that is not the case. It is fully possible to not even
be inside the game to do this thanks to how the API of VRChat is. VRChat has an API that users can use (if they can figure out the endpoints, said endpoints 
have  been documented already) for various purposes such as automating tasks that normally one would do in the game or on their website. VRChat happens to 
have an endpoint that allows a user to get the information of an avatar using the id of the avatar.

Avatar id? Every avatar in the game has an id and typically looks like: avtr_1a413261-1ue3-93aa-c20e-90d0ge517281

If you want to use the developer tools on browsers with it, you can see that whenever you attempt to access the page of an avatar, the following is accessed:
<code>https://vrchat.com/api/1/avatars/[avatarid]</code>

Whenever this is accessed, a response is given, giving you information on who made the avatar (their in game name and id), the avatar's description, when it 
was made, the name of the avatar, and more. Funny enough, the information one is looking for will not be found here.

As such, we will need to do a bit more in order to get access to the file we want, said file will end with a .vrca extension. Funny enough, this is not hard 
with python with the implementation going as follows.


First, we will want to import <code>requests</code>, specifically <code>Session</code>. This will allow us to more easily manage authentication / cookies at 
needed later on.
<code class="block">
from requests import Session
</code>

We will also right now want to import a few more for later use including <code>loads</code> from <code>json</code>, <code>b64encode</code> from <code>base64</code>, and both <code>mkdir</code> and
<code>path</code> from <code>os</code>.
<code class="block">
from requests import Session
from base64 import b64encode
from json import loads
from os import path, mkdir
</code>

Once we have these, we can now start with the main part of the code. We will first want to initialize a session by setting a variable to a new <code>Session()</code>. 
After which, we can do the easy route of now making an alternate account on VRChat (or use your main one if you feel like rolling the dice on getting banned 
for doing this as you can be) and putting the credentials into variables. The reason we will be doing this is because VRChat requires an <b>Authorization</b> 
header in specific requests that has a value equal to (yes literally) "Basic [username]:[password]" passed. Implemented into python this all will look like:
<code class="block">
session = Session()

username = [your username]
password = [your password]
encodedInformation = b64encode(f'{username}:{password}'.encode()).decode()
</code>

          
Easy so far right? Next, we will specify some headers for our requests. Some of these headers we will use will be to trick whatever you are trying to access 
into thinking that it is being access from a browser. After that, we will add the <b>Authorization</b> header and use the <code>encodedInformation</code> 
variable with "Basic" prepended to it using an f-string to keep it simple.
<code class="block">
requestHeaders = {'User-Agent': 'Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_9_3) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/35.0.1916.47 Safari/537.36'}
requestHeaders['Authorization'] = f'Basic {encodedInformation}'
</code>


We are getting there we will now need to make a quick <b>GET</b> request to VRChat's API at their authentication endpoint. After we have done so, the 
<code>session</code> variable set to <code>Session()</code> will keep track of necessary details. We will also add a url variable of 
<code>?apiKey=JlE5Jldo5Jibnk5O5hTx6XVqsJu4WJ26</code> to the end of the endpoint (this is required by VRChat).
<code class="block">
session.get('https://api.vrchat.cloud/api/1/auth/user?apiKey=JlE5Jldo5Jibnk5O5hTx6XVqsJu4WJ26', data = None, headers = requestHeaders)
</code>


Now, some people may have TFA on their account (and you might have set it up on this account). As such, we can specific an extra chunk of code to 
account for this (note this will only accept the 6 digit long codes typically seen on authentication apps) note the 
<code>?apiKey=JlE5Jldo5Jibnk5O5hTx6XVqsJu4WJ26</code> being passed still as a url variable.
<code class="block">
tfa = [your TFA code]
session.post(('https://api.vrchat.cloud/api/1/auth/twofactorauth/totp/verify?apiKey=JlE5Jldo5Jibnk5O5hTx6XVqsJu4WJ26'), {'code' : tfa}, headers = requestHeaders)
requestHeaders.pop('Authorization')
</code>


Now we can get into the real bit. See, the .vrca file was not given when we initially checked the endpoint for the avatar information. I neglected 
an important detail: that being that the file will be given so long as you are currently in that avatar. As such, we can make a <b>PUT</b> request 
to VRChat to select that avatar for us. After doing so, we will switch into that avatar and can then utilize the same endpoint from earlier to get 
the information of the avatar.
<code class="block">
avatarID = [avatar ID here]

session.put(f'https://api.vrchat.cloud/api/1/avatars/{avatarID}/select', data = None, headers = self.requestHeaders)
  
req = session.get('https://api.vrchat.cloud/api/1/auth/user?apiKey=JlE5Jldo5Jibnk5O5hTx6XVqsJu4WJ26', data = None, headers = requestHeaders)
req = loads(req.__dict__['_content'])
avatarUrl = req['currentAvatarAssetUrl']
</code>

          
Notice where <code>loads()</code> from <code>json</code> was used. We then will access the "currentAvatarAssetUrl" variable from the newly made 
<code>req</code> dictionary holding our user information. Yes, our user information. This is getting our currently selected avatar's asset url. 
If we want, we can now get the avatar's name (to make things pretty).
<code class="block">
req = session.get(f'https://api.vrchat.cloud/api/1/avatars/{avatarID}?apiKey=JlE5Jldo5Jibnk5O5hTx6XVqsJu4WJ26', data = None, headers = self.requestHeaders)
req = loads(req.__dict__['_content'])
avatarName = req['name']
</code>


At this point, we can now download this asset using the url we got (as it is the .vrca file we are looking for):
<code class="block">
req = session.get(avatarUrl, data=None, headers = requestHeaders)
</code>


After doing this, we can now save it to a new file in a new directory we will make making sure to save the file as a .vrca file.
<code class="block">
avatarFolder = f'{path.dirname(path.abspath(__file__))}/Avatars/{avatarName}'
mkdir(avatarFolder)
with open(f'{avatarFolder}/{avatarID}.vrca', 'wb') as (f): f.write(req._content)
</code>


Next, to avoid having VRChat see a lot of opened clients for the account you used, we will use their logout endpoint:
<code class="block">
session.put('https://api.vrchat.cloud/api/1/logout', data = None, headers = requestHeaders)
</code>


And that is it! That simple. No need to login in the game, just do this! Please I ask for you to be response with this and I will make a note that you can 
get banned from the game for doing this. Maybe soon now VRChat will fix this little thing (or not because it may be necessary). Who knows? The full code for 
this can be seen below:
<code class="block">
