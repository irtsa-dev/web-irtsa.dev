It really has been a while since I made a post, but here we go again. Plenty of things have caught up with me taking
me away from posting here and doing much public work but I decided to put something else out once more.

Yes I know I have been wanting to put out an update for Conarn, but I decided to release another repository for
python related to the console/terminal and printing off colors and/or decorations to it.

Unlike my previous repository: PyTermColor, this new repository: termicol puts all of the functionality of the
two main functions of PyTermColor into one single function. This function also handles coloring and decorating
differently, using tags similar to html (for example <t> or <textcolor> will change the next text into whatever
color is provided in the tag <t=red>). The same concept can be applied to the background and decorations. I also
added a <r> tag to allow for a "reset" if needed.
