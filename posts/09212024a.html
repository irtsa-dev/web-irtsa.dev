As of recently (though technically since around June of this year of 2024) I have been having some fun times in
the game Grey Hack. Rather than explain the game though, I will link it <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/605230/Grey_Hack/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>, go check it out!

Anyhow I have made a lot of random tools/scripts (however you wish to call them) for the game, but I have also been
working to add more functions for scripts due to the lack of built-in functions of the game's language: greyscript.
As a result, I decided to complile some of them in to a single source file to be copy+pasted into the game for
others to use.

If you wish to see them for yourself, you can check them out <a href="https://github.com/irtsa-dev/builtin-greyscript" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>

Short post I know, but still some thing.
