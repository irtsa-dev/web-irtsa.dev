            Grey Hack and Python
        </h1>
        
        <pre>
Yes, I know Grey Hack doesn't use python as the language of choice for making scripts/programs in the game. 
However, what some may notice with my <a href="https://github.com/irtsa-dev/builtin-greyscript" target="_blank" rel="noopener">builtin-greyscript</a> (bltings) repository is that I have been essentially
translating some builtin functions of python into greyscript along with some functions from my other python
repositories such as <a href="https://github.com/irtsa-dev/PyStatistics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PyStatistics</a>.

The game does have limitations with the greyscript language though, so some functions do not look entirely
the same, but they still do the same thing (though how to use them might slightly differ).


Per example, the <b>Factoring()</b> function from <b>PyStatistics</b>:
<code class="block">
def Factors(number: int) -> list:
    Factors = iter(([i, number // i] for i in range(1, int(sqrt(number)) + 1) if number % i == 0))
    return sorted(set([int(i) for e in Factors for i in e]))
</code>

Grey Hack with greyscript does not have <b>list comprehension</b>, so this is a limitation that had to be
worked around when making it for greyscript.
<code class="block">
def Factors(number: int) -> list:
    temp = []
    for i in range(1, int(sqrt(number)) + 1):
        if number % i == 0: temp.append([i, number // i])
  
    factors = []
    for e in temp:
        for i in e: factors.append(int(i))
  
    return sorted(set(factors))
</code>

Then, the syntax for for <b>loops</b> and <b>if</b> statements are a bit different:
<code class="block">
def Factors(number: int) -> list:
    temp = []
    for i in range(1, int(sqrt(number)) + 1)
        if number % i == 0 then temp.append([i, number // i])
    end for

    factors = []
    for e in temp
        for i in e
            factors.append(i)
        end for
    end for

    return sorted(set(factors))
</code>

Now, to add an item to a list in greyscript, one uses the <b>.push()</b> function instead of <b>.append()</b>.
On top of this, we need to replace the <b>int()</b> function with the <b>floor()</b> functions which will work
the same way in this case scenario. We also do not have the <b>set()</b> function, so I made a new
function which will work as we need it to. The <b>sorted()</b> function is also different in
greyscript and is a function of a list where we do .sort afterwards.
<code class="block">
def Factors(number: int) -> list:
    temp = []
    for i in range(1, floor(sqrt(number)) + 1)
        if number % i == 0 then temp.push([i, number // i])
    end for

    factors = []
    for e in temp
        for i in e
            factors.push(i)
        end for
    end for

    return remDups(factors).sort
</code>

Now, we cannot do number // i (which essentially acts like int(number / i)), so we have to do
it like int(number / i) but of course replace the <b>int()</b> function with the <b>floor()</b> function.
Declaring a function also works slightly different, same for ending it, so we need to fix
that too. I also did a bit of variable and function renaming.
<code class="block">
factors = function(number)
    Temp = []
    for i in range(1, floor(sqrt(number)) + 1)
        if number % i == 0 then Temp.push([i, floor(number / i)])
    end for

    Factors = []
    for pair in temp
        for item in pair
            Factors.push(item)
        end for
    end for

    return remDups(factors).sort
end function
</code>

And there we have it, the Factors() function from my PyStatistics repository translated
into greyscript for Grey Hack.


There are many other functions, but I wanted to look at a case scenario in this post to
showcase the limitations of greyscript and work arounds for them as I have been making
the bultin-greyscript repository.
